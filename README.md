# üöå Online Bus Booking - A MERN Based Web Application

**Bus Book** is a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) that allows users to **search, book, and manage bus tickets online**. It supports both user and admin roles, enabling passengers to browse routes, select available seats, and book trips securely, while admins can manage buses, schedules, and bookings from a dedicated dashboard.

This project solves the real-world problem of manual and offline ticketing by offering a 24/7 accessible, user-friendly platform that minimizes booking errors and long queues. It improves convenience for travelers and streamlines transport operations via centralized management.
